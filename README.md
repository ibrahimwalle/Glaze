# About
A React-based corporate portfolio website.

Built using modern React features and libraries such as Hooks, React Router, and React testing library.

Styled using CSS grid layout and flexbox, and animated using keyframes and Svgs.

Designed while following a Responsive approach, so It looks good whether it's on your phone, laptop or tablet!

United tested using Vitest (a Jest based testing tool for React).
